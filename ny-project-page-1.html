      <h3>Steel Sculpture Work</h3>
      <h4>A kinetic sculpture that requires two
        users to complete the activating motion.</h4>
      <p>The structure is worn by to people over their shoulders and around their chest, connected by steel bars on movable joints. The wearers place their wrists into the holders- as they walk closer to each other for an embrace, they are locked from moving further than grazing one anotherâ€™s hands.</p>
        <p>This object is a physical representation of the social boundaries placed upon us both because of the pandemic, and the emotional barriers we encounter on a daily basis.</p>
